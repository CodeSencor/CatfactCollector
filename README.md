# CatfactCollector

[![.NET Build, Package and Release](https://github.com/CodeSencor/CatfactCollector/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CodeSencor/CatfactCollector/actions/workflows/main.yml)
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CodeSencor/CatfactCollector)](https://github.com/CodeSencor/CatfactCollector/releases/latest)

A .NET console application to fetch and store interesting cat facts. It features a generic host service architecture, file IO, basic logging and error handling.

## ‚ú® Features

- Fetches random cat facts from an online API.
- Cross-platform: Standalone executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Automated builds and releases are handled by GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can download the latest pre-compiled executables for your operating system from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/CodeSencor/CatfactCollector/releases) page.

### Usage

1.  Download the appropriate executable for your system (e.g., `CatfactCollector-win-x64.exe` for Windows).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Run the executable.

**For Linux/macOS:**

You may need to make the file executable first:

```bash
chmod +x ./CatfactCollector-linux-x64
./CatfactCollector-linux-x64
```

**For Windows:**

```powershell
./CatfactCollector-win-x64.exe
```

### Command-line Arguments

The application can be configured via an `appsettings.json` file placed in the same directory as the executable. The sample `appsettings.json` can be found [here](https://github.com/CodeSencor/CatfactCollector/blob/master/CatfactCollector/appsettings.json). Alternatively, you can use command-line arguments to override these settings or run the application without `appsettings.json` file alltogether.

| Flag | Alias | Description | Required (if not in `appsettings.json`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--loglevel` | `-l` | Sets the logging level (e.g., `Information`, `Debug`, `Error`). | No (defaults to Information level) |
| `--output` | `-o` | Specifies the path to the output file where cat facts will be saved. | Yes |
| `--endpoint` | `-e` | Sets the URL for the cat fact API. | No (defaults to [https://catfact.ninja/fact](https://catfact.ninja/fact)) |
| `--interval`| `-i` | Sets the interval in seconds for fetching new cat facts. | No (defaults to 5 seconds) |

**Example:**

Run the application with a 10-second interval, debug logging, and save the facts to a custom file named `my-cat-facts.txt`.

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
./CatfactCollector-linux-x64 --interval 10 --output my-cat-facts.txt --loglevel Debug

# For Windows
./CatfactCollector-win-x64.exe --interval 10 --output my-cat-facts.txt --loglevel Debug
```
